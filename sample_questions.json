            "description": "A kirschwasser (/ˈkɪərʃvɑːsər/ KEERSH-vahs-ər; German: [ˈkɪɐ̯ʃvasɐ], German for “cherry water”) or kirsch is a clear, colorless fruit brandy traditionally made from double distillation of morello cherries, a dark-colored cultivar of the sour cherry. However, it is now also made from other kinds of cherries. The cherries are fermented complete (that is, including their stones).[1] Unlike cherry liqueurs and so-called “cherry brandies”, kirschwasser is not sweet .The best kirschwassers have a refined taste with subtle flavors of cherry and a slight bitter-almond taste that derives from the stones.",
